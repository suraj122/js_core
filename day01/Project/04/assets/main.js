//After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.


//Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.


// Write a function called calculateTax which takes an argument 'amount' and calculates the tax you need to pay.


// Write a function named formatAmount which returns you amount in this format '$ 132.45' make the decimal fixed to 2 places.



// Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
