## Use index.html and do the following:

1. Create a webpage with an h1 of "My Book List".
2. Add a script tag to the bottom of the page, where all your JS will go.
3. Use This Array
  ```js
  [{title: 'The Design of EveryDay Things',
   author: 'Don Norman',
   alreadyRead: false
  },
  {title: 'The Most Human Human',
   author: 'Brian Christian',
   alreadyRead: true
  }]
  ```
4. Iterate through the array of books. For each book, create a `p` element with the book title and author and append it to the page.
5. Use a `ul` and `li` to display the books.
6. Add a property to each book with the URL of the book cover, and add an `img` element for each book on the page.
7. Change the style of the book depending on whether you have read it or not.
