//1. Pick a penguin from Wikipedia's List of Fictional Penguins (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_penguins) and create an object named myPenguin with properties that represent the information listed in each column on that Wikipedia page (for example: the character's name, origin, and author).

//2. Use console.log() to print the penguin's name to the console as part of a welcome message, like "Hello, I'm a penguin and my name is [NAME HERE]!"

//. Write another line of code that adds a new property to your penguin called canFly and set it to false.

//4. Add a method to your penguin called chirp that prints to the console: "CHIRP CHIRP! Is this what penguins sound like?"

//5. Add another method to your penguin called sayHello that prints to the console the same message from problem 2 above. But this time, be sure to use the mystical, magical, all-powerful this keyword to access your penguin's name, so that way the sayHello method could potentially work for any penguin that has a name!

//6. Next, call your penguin's sayHello() method and make sure that it works!

//7. Without modifying any of your previous code, change the penguin's name to "Penguin McPenguinFace" and then call your penguin's sayHello() function one more time to make sure it still works.

//8. Write another method called fly, and inside that method, use an if / else statement to print "I can fly!" to the console if your penguin's canFly property is true, or "No flying for me!" if its canFly property is false.

//9. Call your penguin's fly() method and make sure it works!

//10. Change the canFly property to true -- again, without modifying any of your previous code!

//11. Now call your penguin's fly() method again and make sure it works as expected!

//12. Write a for ... in loop to print each key to the console. (Hint: See this page for an example of this special type of loop.)

//13. Write another for ... in loop to print the value of each key to the console. (Hint: You'll need to use bracket notation to access the values this way, instead of dot notation!)

// Exercise 2
// 14.
// Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).
// On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:
// Mole
// Serves: 2
// Ingredients:
// cinnamon
// cumin
// cocoa

// 15.
// Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

// Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).
// Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
// Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
